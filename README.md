I am building a quiz application that gives questions for the user to answer, and also gives the answer and says if the user gets it right or wrong. I want to build this application because I want to see how making a quiz application really looks like. In my UML design, I have the QuizApp class , with different branches. My questions and answers will use string. The score output will use the int method. I will use scanner as well.


Designing the Interface:
Question Label
Answer Input Field
Submit Button
Feedback Label
Score Label
- Focus on layout using Label, TextField, Button, and VBox


By the start of December, I would like to get my JavaFX integrated so I can try my code and see if I made any mistakes. By the start of December, I will hopefully have that integrated, and potentially add questions to make my quiz more exciting. By December, I will see if I should integrate Scanner. In my UML diagram, I outline that I would use scanner, but used another method instead. Figuring out how to download the Java FX has been my biggest challenge yet. I am working with the IntelliJ team now to figure this out.


How my QuizApp works: My project is essentially a simple quiz that gives the user questions to answer. Once the user answer, they can submit and move on to the next question. However, there is a timer so the user is challenged and needs to answer the question fast. It will tell you if you got the answer right or wrong. It will also tell you the correct answer if you are wrong.
